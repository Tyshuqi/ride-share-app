When shares join in the ride, the owner can still edit ride (destination, passenger number and etc), which is unreasonable for sharers if the owner change the destination.
We solved this problem by adding a PENDING state if the ride status is open and sharers have joined in, the owner cannot edit, when ride status is open, they can edit.

Many drivers can claim the same ride, we need to double check the ride status or update it.
